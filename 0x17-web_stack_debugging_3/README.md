	* session handling
	* windows and session management
	* to multiply a terminal

* how to use strace for:
	* keep track of a process
	* diagonising (strace -p 26380)
	* debugging
	* attach to an already running process

* how to degug a process
* how to identify an error line (returns -1)

* how to use puppet to automate the fix
